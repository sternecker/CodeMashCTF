## Information from the CodeMash CTF

2024 Codemash Prime [Codemash 17]

The platform used was [ctfd.io](https://ctfd.io/)  
The tier selected was Plus, which was $100.  
Knew I wanted multiple choice capabilities, and I did not know how many users/hits to expect.

There were problems running the open source version of the CTFd.

Most of the Forensics questions were preloaded by the CTF platform, however they are well known with existing solution write-ups online.  
The Forensic challenges were edited to be unique to Codemash 17.  
The Forensic challenge "All Zipped up" was created for Codemash 17.  
The Cryptography challanges were created for Codemash 17.  
The Multiple Choice questions were based on SSDLC materials from @SecurityCRob (Many thanks!!)
